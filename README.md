## Requirements Specification

Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is the process of documenting all system and user requirements. Below is a detailed explanation of the functional and non-functional requirements of the **Safarny** smart tourism platform.

### Functional Requirements

These define what the system does, highlighting the features and functions the application offers.

#### User Registration and Login
- Tourists and Admins can create new accounts and log in.
- Secure authentication and role-based authorization to control access to different parts of the platform.

#### Tourist Features
- **Smart Onboarding:**  
  Users answer three key questions (budget, trip type, and duration of stay) to receive personalized travel package suggestions.

- **Browse Categories:**  
  Tourists can explore categories such as Ancient Egypt, Beaches, Cities, and Sports.

- **City Exploration:**  
  Users can select a city (e.g., Cairo, Alexandria) and explore:  
  - Hotels (with features, images, room availability, booking, and payment).  
  - Restaurants (with cuisine type filters like Chinese, Breakfast).  
  - Tourist Places (with activities and descriptions).

- **Packages Section:**

  The system should maintain high availability (aiming for 99.9% uptime), with planned maintenance during low-traffic periods.

- **Scalability:**  
  The platform must support increasing numbers of users and data without significant performance degradation.
